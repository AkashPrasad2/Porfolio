## ICS4U

Welcome to my Porfolio, where you can see all the work and projects that I have completed in the last year.

## 1. Khan Academy - Intro to HTML/CSS: Making websites
In this course, I learned all the basics of website creation and the fundementals behind how computer programing works. On top of providing all the basic necessities for making a website, the HTML/CSS languages were used in every program that we coded all year, because it had to be able to run on a website. It was therfore critical to understand how to index different aspects of code correctly so that it would run, even when programing with other languages. This module allowed me to understand and create basic websites, but I believe the most impactful takeaway was being able to navigate the HTML and indices of other programs, and I will continue to dive deeper into these languages in future programs as almost all of them include an HTML aspect.

## Khan Academy - Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation
This module was essential as one of the first steps in computer programing. There are a plethora of reasons why most individuals start off their coding journey by learning Java Script. By being easy to understand and providing quick feeback by being able to see results quickly, it was a good language to start out with. It taught me all the basics of programing including basic syntax, conditional statements, loops, and arrays. From drawing simple to shapes to making complex animations, it provided all the fundamentals in programing. I will continue to use these in Java Script movng forward, and aditionally, many of these concepts can be applied to other programing languages as well, and will make it easier to learn other languages more quickly.

## 2. Khan Academy - Advanced JS: Games and Visualization
After learning all the basics of computer programing, this next module was a great step in refining my skills and deepening my understanding of the coding world. It showed a varaiety of ways that you can program simple videogames with JS, which is possibly the most fun part of programing. Games and Visualizations taught me how the code for games is organized and developped, and general concepts to apply to all my future programs. The biggest takeaway was that it proved how essential object oriented developpment is, and how it can be used to make interactive and more complex programs. In the future, I will use the information from this module to continue to try new things and push the limits with the incredible power of OOP.

## 3. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations
As amazing as programing videogames is, there are a multidue of other applications that it can be used for, which was demonstrated with the Natural Simulations course. We can use progarams to simulate and observe the world we live in and learn countless things that would otherwise be very difficult to learn. Furthermore, there wer many coding concepts that can be used on regular programs that aren't simulations, like using sound functions to make clouds appear in the sky. I also learned a lot about physics and how it can be integrated into programing to create mroe realistic programs. The module focues a lot on randomness, physics, and making things more realistic, which I will be sure to use in the future when developping programs as they can be helpful in a variety of situations. The most useful aspect of the module in my opinion was the integration of physics in computer science it will surely be very important moving forward.
