## Akash Prasad

Welcome to my Porfolio, where you can see all the work and projects that I have completed in the last year.

## 1. Khan Academy - Intro to HTML/CSS: Making websites
In this course, I learned all the basics of website creation and the fundementals behind how computer programing works. On top of providing all the basic necessities for making a website, the HTML/CSS languages were used in every program that we coded all year, because it had to be able to run on a website. It was therfore critical to understand how to index different aspects of code correctly so that it would run, even when programing with other languages. This module allowed me to understand and create basic websites, but I believe the most impactful takeaway was being able to navigate the HTML and indices of other programs, and I will continue to dive deeper into these languages in future programs as almost all of them include an HTML aspect.

## Khan Academy - Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation
This module was essential as one of the first steps in computer programing. There are a plethora of reasons why most individuals start off their coding journey by learning Java Script. By being easy to understand and providing quick feeback by being able to see results quickly, it was a good language to start out with. It taught me all the basics of programing including basic syntax, conditional statements, loops, and arrays. From drawing simple to shapes to making complex animations, it provided all the fundamentals in programing. I will continue to use these in Java Script movng forward, and aditionally, many of these concepts can be applied to other programing languages as well, and will make it easier to learn other languages more quickly.

## 2. Khan Academy - Advanced JS: Games and Visualization
After learning all the basics of computer programing, this next module was a great step in refining my skills and deepening my understanding of the coding world. It showed a varaiety of ways that you can program simple videogames with JS, which is possibly the most fun part of programing. Games and Visualizations taught me how the code for games is organized and developped, and general concepts to apply to all my future programs. The biggest takeaway was that it proved how essential object oriented developpment is, and how it can be used to make interactive and more complex programs. In the future, I will use the information from this module to continue to try new things and push the limits with the incredible power of OOP.

## 3. Khan Academy - Advanced JS: Natural Simulations
As amazing as programing videogames is, there are a multidue of other applications that it can be used for, which was demonstrated with the Natural Simulations course. We can use progarams to simulate and observe the world we live in and learn countless things that would otherwise be very difficult to learn. Furthermore, there wer many coding concepts that can be used on regular programs that aren't simulations, like using sound functions to make clouds appear in the sky. I also learned a lot about physics and how it can be integrated into programing to create mroe realistic programs. The module focues a lot on randomness, physics, and making things more realistic, which I will be sure to use in the future when developping programs as they can be helpful in a variety of situations. The most useful aspect of the module in my opinion was the integration of physics in computer science it will surely be very important moving forward.

## 4. Codecademy: Learn HTML and CSS
Similarly to the Khan Academy HTML course, I learned a lot about the basics of HTML, web develpoment, and correct referencing. While a large portion of it was a review, Codecademy provided a handful of new concepts and tools to enhance websites by making them more practical and aesthetic, like dropdown menus and more. To me, the most useful part of this course was the semantic HTML section, where I learned how to make code more organized and tidy. This was really helpful when making projects in collaboration with others, since organization was very important in order to understand the code of other people. Moving forward, I will continue to use the basics of HTML that i learned from this course and I will be able to make sure that the code is clear and organized. 

## 5. Algorithms with Cubing
Throughout the year, cubing played a huge role in helping to keep me focused while also changing the way that I approached problems within programs. By forming links between the algorithmic nature of a cube to the algorithms involved in a computer, it became easier to grasp computer science concepts and develop my own programs. This year, I have managed to solve a 3x3, 2x2 and pyramix, by studying the algorithms behind them, and I discovered that despite their differences, there are still many similarites. Similarly, there are similarities between different programing languages as well. In the future, I will contine to challenge myself with new cubes while also increasing my speed with previous solves so that I can be more efficinet at problem solving and computer programing.

## 6. Microbit
The microbit is an incredibly versitile device that allows you to convert the software from a computer onto the device hardware. It was a beginner friendly way to quickly see the results of your programs, although it still had lots of potential as well. Microbit is such a powerful tool in learning computer programing because of their platform that allows you to drag and connet blocks. This was an excellent way to be able to visualize your code and it meant that you could focus on the logic of the code rather that the syntax which would change with each language. We were able to design our own mini game on the microbit, and for me, the most useful aspect of the project was how it let you visualize how the code really works and you could play with it without studying all the syntax before hand. While I may not be using microbit again, I will still use the concepts in other programs and it is likely that future code will be put into hardware silimar to the way we did with the microbit.

## 7. Hackathon - Acessible Education
For this project, we developed a website in effort to give easy access to anyone with internet completely for free. In this group project, I learned all the essentials of developing a program in collaboration with others, and how to stay organized so multiple people could work on it at once. Using github was essential as it was the repository where we stored our code for the website, and it also let us keep track of progress for the website. By using the project board, we could clearly see what needed to be worked on, what was completed, and monitor everything about out project. The biggest takeaway from this task was how to work together on the same program and use github to stay organized. There is no doubt that I will work on programs with others and so all these skills will be crucial.

## 8. Live Coding Session
The live coding project gave us an oppertunity to demonstrate a high level of understanding of computer programing, because we had to explain it to everyone else, and because you had to program it on the spot. A big part of this project was the integration, in which we had to integrate out different code and functions together so that they would work properly together.
